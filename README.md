  2. (Done) A section off of the main menu to find local donation sites
  	* Salvation Army
  	* Churches

  3. A section off of the main menu to view different stitches. Clicking a stich name from this list will
  then lead to a page showing the steps to complete the stitch. (aka Stitch Dictionary) (Since there are so many stitches, this will be a large work in progress)
