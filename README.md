KnitWit
=======

A knitting manager application. 

Implementation plan: 

  Stage 1: Add a section off of the main menu to count rows completed when knitting a pattern.
  
  Stage 2: Add a section off of the main menu to view different stitches. Clicking a stich name from this list will
  then lead to a page showing the steps to complete the stitch.
  
More to come as the software develops.
